# Results & Analysis

This section highlights the performance of each regression model and most importantly interprets key results from both numerical evaluation and feature analysis.

## Feature Importance Across Models

After crossing all models, the top-ranked features were remarkably consistent:

| **Feature**          | **Importance Signal (Ridge/Lasso)** | **Interpretation**                                                   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| area                 | Very High                           | Strong, direct effect on price—larger homes sell for more.            |
| airconditioning      | High                                | Adds perceived comfort and luxury, justifying a price premium.        |
| parking              | High                                | Reflects urban convenience—more parking = higher demand.              |
| prefarea             | Moderate–High                       | Captures neighborhood desirability; a strong location proxy.          |
| bathrooms            | Moderate                            | Additional bathrooms correlate with size and utility.                 |
| furnishingstatus     | Low–Moderate (varies by model)      | Has subtle impact; may overlap with socioeconomic signals.            |

## Heuristic Reasoning and Feature Relationships

**Overlap:**  
Some features seem to measure overlapping concepts: `area`, `stories`, and `bathrooms` all relate to house size and livability. This suggests multicollinearity, and regularisation (Lasso/Ridge) will favor `area` as the most influential feature.  
Similarly, `prefarea` and `furnishingstatus` might each serve as a proxy for socioeconomic desirability (furnishing might simply echo neighborhood-based norms or buyer wealth), but neither clearly dominates on its own.

**Binary Characteristics and Step-Value Effects:**  
Some categorical features (e.g., `airconditioning`, `basement`, `guestroom`) exhibited step-function patterns in PDPs:

- **Air conditioning** was on average associated with a large, positive shift in predicted price compared to homes without A/C.
- **Basement and Guestroom** also had noticeable effects, but their utility appears to be highly context-dependent—e.g., basements may be more valued in suburban regions than urban cores or flood-prone zones.
