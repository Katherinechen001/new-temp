It describes a data record on 545 homes with 13 variables that consist of a mixture of predictive numeric and categorical attributes to describe the features of the homes. The target variable is price, the sale price of each house. 

## Feature Description

## Initial Observations 
The data, including binary, and multi-class which are pre-processed to be suitable for modeling. No missing values were detected in the dataset, and hence analysis should be straightforward. The variable area would seem to be most obviously related to cost, as it is known that larger properties are more expensive.
