    "text": "1 Introduction\nIntroduction The US housing market is affected by multiple factors that result from property physical characteristics, the location related and structural feature. For would-be buyers and sellers, real estate professionals, policy-makers and investors who are seeking data-driven insights, knowing what is behind the price of a house is important. In this experiment, I analyzed what the most important factors are behind the housing price in the Us with a Kaggle dataset (545 observations and 13 features) with what I would call intuitive variables such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, whether the house has any amenities (e.g., guestroom, basement, air condition) and furnishing status. To perform this analysis I use a set of regression methods — Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic Net, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor. These models are measured by a set of error indicators such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R². Comparing these models’ performance, I determined the best method in predicting the price of a house. I then look at the feature importances to see which feature of a listing has the greatest effect on the price. Finally, visualizations and prediction results are shown to aid interpretation and validate the conclusions. This report seeks to develop an empirical, data-based overview of US house price dynamics and to provide a simple approach as to what factors contribute most to house prices."
