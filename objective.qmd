# Objective
The main goal of this project is to understand and measure the determinants affecting housing prices in the US. The objective of the task is twofold: (Using multiple regression methods based on model fitness index.)
Identification of Key Features: Identify the most impactful housing attributes – for example: area, number of rooms, utilities, or the geographical location the house is situated in.
Predicting housing prices: The task is to develop an accurate model that can estimate the price of a house based on its features.
My goal with this project is to cull patterns to guide real estate related decision-making and to offer practical insight into the housing market.
